# MNIST-Classification
Chapter 3 of Hands On Machine Learning by Geron

We use the MNIST dataset from scikit to practice classification tasks. We start with a binary classifier: determining whether a number is a 5 or not a 5. From there, we develop a more robust code to classify all 10 digits from each other.

We analyze error using confusion matrices, and use the results to improve the classification algorithm.
